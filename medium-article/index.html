      <h2>Species of Monkey</h2>
      <p>
        Most of them live in trees except for a few who seem to prefer the ground like baboons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, monkeys are thought of as highly intelligent animals.
      </p>
      <h2>How Big Are Monkeys?</h2>
      <p>
        The length of monkeys range from 5 to 6 inches (140 to 160 mm) including their tails.
      </p>
      <p>
        They weigh about 4 to 5 ounces, which is about 120 to 140 grams.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are some bigger species too that are 3.3 feet long (1 meter) and can weigh up to 77 pounds (35 kilograms).
      </p>
      <h2>What Do Monkeys Eat?</h2>
      <p>
        Monkeys of all types have completely different diets, but the most common food that all of them eat are seeds, flowers,
        eggs, fruits, leaves, nuts, and small insects including spiders.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’ll pretty much eat anything that smells good, or bad…
      </p>
      <p>
        They are very, very sociable and they have a mostly friendly attitude towards humans. Some of them though are a bit
        naughty as they can cause a lot of damage to crops. They’re seen as pests.
